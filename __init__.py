# I'm empty! :)

# What we are given: center point of the back axle of the moving car: movecar_axlept
# D = length of the parking space: parkspace_len
# 4 coordinates of the two cars we want to park between: frontcar_up, frontcar_down, backcar_up, backcar_down
# Steering angle: steer_ang

# X0 = position of movecar_axlept when the back of the cars are aligned
# X1 = position of movecar_axlept when the back axle and the back of the front car are aligned

# Let's define more variables: movecar_backaxle, movecar_frontaxle (describe positions of front and back axle of moving car)
# We can therefore define len_axle as the length between the front and back axle of moving car
# Let's also define the width and length of the actual car, CAR_WIDTH, CAR_LENGTH
